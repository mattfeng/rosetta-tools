B) year_week_revID internal, year.week.revID external nomenclature  (done)
B) lookup Sergey's script to determine revID from a git hash (done, except it gets the revID number wrong, not yet finished implementing on Sergey's end)
B) - works for git branch mostly, but FAILS for release filename - tie into repaired svn_version.py system
svn_version.py should be a no-op within release (to leave last git info in place!), ALSO should include branch name

C) build documentation, after documentation is a valid repository
Note: need to remove static html after rosetta copy is made

also fix the documentation README

D) create a new git repository: 
-strip a release, create git repository from that
for next release, remove all files in repo (filesystem rm)
copy all files from next stripped release
git commit -a THIS big pile of changes, to produce releases as a git repository

F) start choosing releases from specially chosen test server builds (on Thursday night, it splits off a revision to do all platform/unit tests)
f status: scriptside complete.  test server side complete.
need a flag to choose revision if auto-release head is inappropriate, or maybe manually pick future release heads?

H) examine unit test timing - consider defaulting most residuetypes off in unit tests
Result: looks like it's just that slow:
- commenting out all the patches in the patch file didn't speed it up
- removing all the patches in-code with exclude didn't speed it up
- one or two tests seem extra-slow (AtomTypeDatabaseIOTests) but can't account for all issues
