## Script Dependencies
1.  A public app called  `packing_angle` needs to be compiled (if not by default):
   - source: `/path/to/Rosetta/main/source/src/apps/public/antibody/packing_angle.cc`
   - binary: `/path/to/Rosetta/main/source/bin/packing_angle.macosclangrelease`
2.  Angles from PDB:
   - `/path/to/Rosetta/tools/antibody/angles.sc`
   - (1MCO was removed because it was an outlier)
3.  The output generated by the antibody homology modeling application (`antibody`)
4.  The output generated by the `H3_modeling` application (`antibody_H3`)


## Script Output

 *  a histogram with naturally occurring LHOC coordinates as found in
 	crystal structures of antibodies.
 *  a histogram of the LHOC coordinates decoys generated during H3 modeling
 *  the LHOC coordinates of the top 10 decoys after H3 modeling as assessed by
 	total scores
 *  the LHOC coordinates of the 10 templates generated during multi template
 	grafting


## Example Script Usage:

 `python plot_LHOC.py -l remodel_h3_files.txt -l:temp template_directories.txt -out output_dir -l:names output_names`

`remodel_h3_files.txt` is a list of score files produced by `antibody_H3` and looks something like this:

```
/Users/guest/antibody_a/remodel_h3.fasc
/Users/guest/antibody_b/remodel_h3.fasc
/Users/guest/antibody_c/remodel_h3.fasc
/Users/guest/antibody_d/remodel_h3.fasc
/Users/guest/antibody_e/remodel_h3.fasc
```

`template_directories.txt` is a list of directories containing the grafting output of `antibody.py` and looks something like this:
```
/Users/guest/antibody_a/grafting
/Users/guest/antibody_b/grafting
/Users/guest/antibody_c/grafting
/Users/guest/antibody_d/grafting
/Users/guest/antibody_e/grafting
```
