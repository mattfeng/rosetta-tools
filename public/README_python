This directory is intended for Python scripts that act as Rosetta executables
(under apps/) or provide common functionality for such scripts (under the other
directories).  

Most application scripts contain code to make sure the Rosetta Python libraries
are on the PYTHONPATH, but if you get an error that says "ImportError: No
module named ..." or you want to use these libs in your own scripts, add the
following to your ~/.bash_profile:

    export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/rosetta/rosetta_source/src/python:$PYTHONPATH"

Make the appropriate changes for where your copy of Rosetta actually lives.
Syntax is similar but not identical if you use csh or tcsh instead of Bash.

Developers:  if you create new lib directories, the __init__.py files are
required for Python to treat them as modules.
